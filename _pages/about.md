Welcome! My name is Brooks, a computer science student at Quinnipiac University with a minor in game design. I am currently employed at Medicus Healthcare Solutions as an intern for the summer of 2024. As far as interests go, I am still unsure as to what specification in the computer science field I want to go into, however I am particularly intrigued by **machine learning**, **OPSEC** and **full-stack software development**.

## Experience

### [Summer 2024] Intern @ [Medicus](https://medicushcs.com/)

### [Fall 2023] Sponsorship Coordinator @ [Quinnipiac Computing Club](https://www.linkedin.com/company/quinnipiac-computing-club/)

Worked with sponsors to get prize money for the Fall 2023 Quinnipiac Hackathon. This involved emailing companies and scheduling times to meet about what the prize money should be. Additionally, as a board member, helped to setup club events.

### [Summer 2023] Intern @ [Picabuu](https://www.linkedin.com/company/picabuu/)

Helped with front and back-end development to test and fix bugs in the code. Additionally took feedback from testers and implemented the feedback. All of this contributed to a published app on the App Store.

## Projects

The full list of my projects and coursework can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/bjaxqq).

### [[May. 2024] Quinnipiac Tracker](https://github.com/bajackson1/QuinnipiacTracker)

> Kotlin, SQLite, Android Studio, Scrum/Agile Cycles

An Android app for information and location journaling at Quinnipiac University. Used to mark buildings the user has visited and provides information about each one.

### [[Dec. 2023] Quinnipiac: A Campus Quest](https://a-r-t.github.io/SER225-Project-Website/semesters/fall2023/teams/art)

> Java, Scrum/Agile Cycles

A game based on life at Quinnipiac University. As a newly admitted student, you complete quests across campus locations such as the quad and the hockey arena to make it to graduation. This was my first big team project.

### [[Nov. 2023] Tetris](https://github.com/bjaxqq/tetris)

> Java, Eclipse

Inspired by the classic game, this recreation of Tetris tested object-oriented design skills using Java. Utilizing various libraries, this game includes sounds for different aspects of the game and stays true to the ruleset and scoring of the original game. My first non-school project.
